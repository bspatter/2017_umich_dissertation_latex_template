I would like to acknowledge my deepest appreciation to my advisors
Eric Johnsen and David R. Dowling. To Eric, your mentorship was
invaluable at learning to what it means to understand what you don't
know. Through working with you, I have a much better understanding
of how I work and what I need to succeed. Furthermore, your
flexibility and encouragement as I chased my many outreach and side
projects has made this experience all the more worthwhile. To
Professor Dowling, you taught me the difference between science and
engineering and helped me to figure which I enjoyed, and which I was
good at. The support and structure you provided in the last half of
my Ph.D. was essential and I couldn't have finished without it. I
also extend my thanks to my committee members. To Brian Fowlkes and
Doug Miller, thanks for many interesting conversations and great
insight, and for keeping my theoretical work a bit more true to
reality than it otherwise would have been. To Bill Schultz, thanks
for being not only a mentor, but an open minded friend, our chats
and adventures in Ghana
are some of my favorite moments of my PhD.\\

This dissertation would not have been survived, let alone completed,
if it were not for the support of my friends. I would like to thank:
Marc for joining me in everything from cartoon bubbles to sake bomb
dynamics; Brian for consistently being a bad influence when I needed
one; Louise for walks; TJ for edifying reasons to not work; Alex for
brews at dive bars; Sam for unintentional deep conversations at 8am;
Shahab for constant kindness; Phil for exquisite facial expressions;
Adaleena for being herself; Mauro for being a kindred midwesterner;
Suyash for taking over as the Linux guy; Siddhesh for the best
questions; Negin for the best high fives; and Lisa for bringing
continuous spirit to the office. Additionally, thanks to the ME
staff who have made my life easier and more fun, especially Melissa
and Kathie. Thanks also to my friends from Purdue and Chesterton for
distant emphathy and Mario Kart. Thanks to my brother for never
censoring himself, Aunt Diane for continuing to inspire me to chase
crazy dreams, and to Dad for absolutely everything. To Mom, I
wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you pushing me for all of those
years, I love you and you are deeply missed. To Doe Doe and The
Leviathan, thanks for bringing a sense of family to my home and
keeping Liz sane. Lastly, to my wonderful wife, Liz ``Chicken''
Patterson for
pushing me, caring for me, feeding me, and all of the many adventures in between.\\
