\centerline{\large\bf PREFACE}
\vspace*{1in}
This dissertation presents work in which computation and modeling are
used to make advancements in two separate and distinct areas of
acoustics: ultrasound bioeffects modeling (which serves to motivated
the bulk of this thesis) and acoustic transmission loss uncertainty
quantification in uncertain ocean environments. While these works are
united in the use of computation and broader field of acoustics, the
underlying motivation and relevant background is separate. Hence this
document is split into two separate and distinct parts along these
lines. A summary of relevant background information, work performed,
and conclusions in each area will be presented separately.
