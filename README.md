University of Michigan 2017 dissertation latex template - Rackham complient
# Adapted by Brandon Patterson, 2017 - awesome@umich.edu

The main files to look at main.tex and thesis-umich.cls. These two files dictate the structure and content of the dissertation. 
In theory, you should only need to change main.tex and its dependencies.

Good luck!
