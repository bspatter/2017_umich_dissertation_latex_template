This dissertation presents work in which computational modeling is
used to advance two areas of interest in modern acoustics. First, we
develop computational models to study the poorly understood physics
underlying \ac{CEUS} bioeffects and \ac{DUS}-induced lung
hemorrhage. A better understanding of these problems is critical to
the development of science-based safety guidelines. Because inertial
cavitation is thought to cause \ac{CEUS} bioeffects, we model a
spherical bubble in viscoelastic soft tissue, driven by
experimentally-measured ultrasound waveforms ($1.5-7.5$ MHz), with
known bioeffects thresholds. Bioeffects thresholds were compared with
calculated cavitation metrics and experimentally determined bioeffects
thresholds were found greater than accepted thresholds for inertial
cavitation in water, and that the maximum dimensionless bubble radius
$R_{max}/R_0$ correlated strongly with bioeffects thresholds as a
function of frequency. Separately, we investigate \ac{DUS}-induced
lung hemorrhage and model an acoustic wave in soft tissue (water)
traveling toward an alveolus (air) with a perturbed surface. First, a
trapezoidal wave with ultrasonically relevant properties ($5.0-12.5$
MPa pressures amplitudes, $1.3-6.0~\mu$s wave durations), drives the
interface. We showed that acoustic waves may be capable of depositing
sufficient baroclinic vorticity to drive significant interface
perturbation growth, long after the wave has passed. This growth
scaled with the circulation density (i.e., the circulation per unit
length of the interface) and exhibited power-law behavior at late
time. To approximate \ac{US}-induced stresses and strains on alveoli,
we subjected interfaces of varying initial perturbation amplitude to
$1.5$ MHz ultrasound pulses with peak amplitudes from $1-5$ MPa
and observed interfacial viscous stress amplitudes up to approximately
$60$ Pa and interfacial strains up to 38\%. While the viscous
stresses appeared beneath capillary failure thresholds, the calculated
strain was sometimes greater than expected failure thresholds for
alveolar epithelium. Since this work considers only a single pulse,
and the vorticity driving the deformation is expected to accumulate
over multiple pulses, we conclude that vorticity-induced deformation
is worthy of further investigation.

Finally, we develop \textit{area statistics}, a computationally
efficient method for estimating \acp{PDF} of acoustic \ac{TL} in
uncertain ocean environments. Such \acp{PDF} of \ac{TL} are useful for
real-time Naval applications but impractically expensive to obtain
via traditional computational methods. This work describes how to
approximate the \ac{PDF} of \ac{TL} at a point of interest using
\ac{TL} statistics from the field surrounding the point of
interest. The idea is that local \ac{TL} variations due to
environmental fluctuations are represented by spatial variations in
\ac{TL} in single baseline \ac{TL} field calculation. The baseline
calculation used the most probable values for uncertain parameters
describing the sound speed profile, bathymetry, and geoacoustic
bottom-layer properties. \textit{Area statistics}-generated \acp{PDF}
were compared with 2000-sample Monte Carlo-generated \acp{PDF} via the
$L_1$ error, in ten ocean environments with varying properties and
uncertainties, for source frequencies of 100, 200, and 300 Hz and
depths of 91, 137, 183m. The \textit{area statistics}-generated
\acp{PDF} had an $L_1$ error $<$ 0.5 in 91\% of the 11,000+ test
locations (depths from 20 m - 4.5 km, ranges from $<$1 km to $>$70
km). \textit{Area statistics} \ac{PDF}s were generated in
milliseconds, required $\sim10^{-6}$ times the computational effort
required for Monte Carlo \ac{PDF}s and were thus suitable for
real-time applications.

In summary, this dissertation contains: 1.) research in which computational
models of \ac{CEUS} and ultrasound-alveolar interaction were developed
and used to study the physics of relevant ultrasound-induced
bioeffects, and 2.) \emph{area statistics}, a real-time appropriate
computational technique for estimating \acs{PDF} of \ac{TL} in
uncertain ocean environments, is developed and tested.
